# LinkedLists :jigsaw:
## C algorithm to create and modify linked lists using reference parameter
This is a refactored project that I developed as a requirement at college. As expected from a C algorithm-only, it's just a black terminal screen showing a bunch numbers and basic instructions.

The original code was such a mess and with a ton of code repetition, so I decided to organize it properly and avoid the fearsome CTRL+V. Despite simple, it was very important to make me understand pointers and memory adress.
