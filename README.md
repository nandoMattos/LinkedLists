### _C algorithm to create and modify linked lists
This is a refactored project I developed as a requirement at college. As expected from a C algorithm-only, it's just a black terminal screen showing a bunch numbers and basic instructions. The application features basic manipulations in linked lists, including basic insertion, ascending order insertion, remove element, print list and split list.

The original code was such a mess and with a ton of code repetition, so I decided to organize it properly and avoid the fearsome CTRL+V. Despite simple, it was very important to make me understand a few abstract concepts such as pointers and memory adress.
